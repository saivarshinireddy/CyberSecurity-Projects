This step-by-step walkthrough provided practical insights into using Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets, a fundamental skill in network security and troubleshooting.

In wrapping up this project, I've personally gained practical experience and insights into the world of Wireshark. The hands-on exploration allowed me to navigate the tool efficiently, starting and stopping packet captures, and saving the results for later analysis. Witnessing the visual representation of captured packets enhanced my ability to interpret and make sense of network traffic. This experience has not only equipped me with essential skills in using Wireshark but has also deepened my understanding of network protocols. I now feel more confident in my ability to conduct network diagnostics, assess security, and troubleshoot issues effectively. This project has been a valuable step in my journey towards mastering network analysis and security.
